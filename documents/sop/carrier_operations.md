## Carrier Departure
### CASE I Departure
This departure may be utilized when it is anticipated that flights will not encounter instrument conditions during
departures and rendezvous with weather conditions no lower than 3,000 feet and 5 nm visibility.

Line up at the Catapult and Launch:
Lead aircraft will line up first, the wingmen will line up on other available Catapults, if none available, line up behind the JBD (Jet Blast Deflector). Preferred catapults if free is in the following order:

After the lead got Take-Off Clearance he will announce “spooling up” and when his wingman on CAT III is also at 80% RPM and both called out “in the green” Lead announces “Full Afterburner”  both engage lights and go full AB, do a quick full deflection of all control surfaces to have deck crew observe correct working controls, center stick and launch will start within a few seconds.

Notes: 
CAT I + CAT III and CAT II + CAT IV can takeoff together 
Between CAT I and CAT II or CAT III and CAT IV launches is a separation of minimum 20(30 IRL) seconds required 

After Launch from the Catapult CASE I:
After a clearing turn, proceed straight ahead paralleling the BRC at 500 feet until 7 DME. Aircraft are then cleared to
climb unrestricted in visual conditions.

Clearing Turn:
A clearing turn is executed to create upwind separation between departing aircraft and aircraft remaining in the landing pattern. It also serves as a visual signal of the aircraft’s intent to depart the carrier. A clearing turn shall be executed during all case I and II launches when the aircraft is departing the carrier. Clearing turns shall be made to the right off the bow catapults  and to the left off the waist catapults for 20 degrees of heading chang followed by a reversal of turn to parallel the BRC. Clearing turns shall not be executed by aircraft during case III launches or when the aircraft intends to remain in the landing pattern.

Launch Frequencies: Aircraft shall normally launch on the departure frequency that shall be monitored by the tower.

### Case II Departure 
For departure, visual conditions at the ship may exist down to a ceiling of 1,000 feet and visibility of 5 miles. Launch
shall be on departure control frequency.

Line up at the Catapult and Launch:
Lead aircraft will line up first, the wingmen will line up on other available Catapults, if none available, line up behind the JBD (Jet Blast Deflector). After the lead got Take Off Clearance he will go Full Afterburner power, do a quick full deflection of all control surfaces to have deck crew observe correct working controls, center stick and launch will start within a few seconds.

After Launch from the Catapult CASE II:
After a clearing turn, proceed straight ahead at 500 feet paralleling the BRC. At 7 DME, turn to intercept the 10-nm
arc, maintaining visual conditions until established on the departure radial. The 500-foot restriction is lifted after
7 nm if the climb can be continued in visual conditions. Jets shall maintain 300 knots until VMC on top.

### Case III Departure
This departure shall be used whenever existing weather at the ship is below Case II departure minimums and during
all night operations except as modified by the OTC or commanding officer. Case III departures are compatible only
with Case III recoveries. The launch shall be on departure control frequency. A minimum launch interval of
30 seconds shall be used between aircraft. When possible, a 60-second interval will be provided when launching a
jet aircraft following a turboprop.

Line up at the Catapult and Launch:
Lead aircraft will line up first, the wingmen will line up on other available Catapults, if none available, line up behind the JBD (Jet Blast Deflector). After the lead got Take Off clearance and when the pilot is ready, he turns on his Navigation Lights to STEADY to signal he is prepared for launch. Then go Full Afterburner power, do a quick full deflection of all control surfaces to have deck crew observe correct working controls, center stick and launch will start within a few seconds.

After Launch from the Catapult CASE III:
Climb straight ahead accelerating at 300 knots crossing 5 nm at 1,500 feet or above. At 7 DME, execute turn to fly the 10-nm arc until intercepting the briefed departure radial.

## CARRIER RECOVERY PROCEDURES
### ARRIVAL AND RECOVERY
Following the mission, aircraft will proceed back to Mother to arrive at their scheduled cyclic land time. After checking out on the mission frequency, contact the CSG air defense controller (Red Crown) with your call sign, position and altitude. Red Crown will pass instructions, and then hand you off to Strike Control. This hand off should occur prior to entering the 50 NM Carrier Control Area (CCA). The check in with Strike will be the same as for Red Crown except you will also include the low fuel state in your flight. If any aircraft in the flight have maintenance discrepancies (“alibis”), pass them to the Strike controller who will then relay them to the ready room. Time permitting; Strike will give the current weather, anticipated Case recovery and any other general information for the recovery.

Once inside the CCA, Strike will hand aircraft off to the Marshal controller. Check in on Marshal Frequency with call sign, position, altitude and low state. Marshal will assign case recovery holding instructions (including assigned altitude) and pass the ship’s weather, altimeter setting, BRC and bingo information. BRC is the ship’s heading during the recovery.

For Case I recoveries, Marshal will clear aircraft to the overhead holding pattern and instruct you to call “see me” at 10NM from the ship. This call indicates you have visual contact with Mother. For Case II and III recoveries, Marshal will give holding instructions and an expected approach time (push time).

Note
In DCS we will conduct this on the primary Mother radio channel, in real life there are a minimum of 4 people/radios needed.

Example radio calls: Blue = Aircraft - Red = Mother, Marshal, Paddles, LSO, etc. - [lines] are not used

[405 		 “Red Crown, 405, Mother’s 250 for 75, Angels 17” ]
[Red Crown 	 “405, sweet/sweet, contact Strike” ]

[405 		“Strike, 405, Mother’s 250 for 55, Angels 12, State 2.4. No alibis” ]
[Strike 		“405, sweet/sweetä, Mother is VFR, Case I is in effect. Contact Marshal” ]

405 		 “Marshal, 405, 250 for 52, Angels 9, State 2.4”
Marshal 	 “405, Case I. BRC is 015, Expected Charlie time 22. Report see me”
or
Marshal		“405, Case II (or III) in effect. BRC is 015. Marshal on the 245 radial at 25 DME, Angels 10. Expected 
approach time 22, Approach button 17, altimeter 29.94”

Marshal Arrival Information:

The flight leader shall provide the following information when checking in with Marshal Control:
1. Position
2. Altitude
3. Fuel state (low state in flight)
4. Total number of aircraft in flight (lineup)
5. Type approach requested — UTMs sweet (if applicable)
6. Other pertinent information such as navigational aid status, hung or unexpended ordnance, weather, etc., that
may affect recovery

## CASE I Recovery: 
Case I recoveries are used to the maximum extent possible, provided the weather is better than 3,000/5.

Overhead (Port) Holding 

After the initial check in with Marshal, proceed directly to Mother and enter overhead holding at your squadron’s holding altitude. When in visual contact with Mother, notify Marshal with the “see you” call. Aircraft returning for Case I recoveries must be established at their respective holding altitudes no later than 10 NM. Proceed to overhead holding, and enter the pattern tangentially.

The overhead holding pattern is a left-hand pattern, with Point 1 located directly overhead the carrier. Points 2, 3 and 4 sequentially follow in 90-degree increments . This holding pattern is often referred to as the “stack,” and all aircraft must remain within 5 NM and no lower than 2,000 feet AGL. While holding, the flight will remain at max conserve fuel flow unless briefed otherwise.

Each squadron has an assigned holding altitude in the stack, beginning at 2,000 feet AGL. These assigned altitudes are separated vertically by a minimum of 1,000 feet and are assigned by the CVW SOP. Once established in holding, any altitude changes within the pattern are accomplished as follows:
 
Climbs: Performed between points 1 and 3. 
Descents: Performed between points 3 and 1.

The lowest aircraft in the stack must closely monitor the launch so as to arrive in the groove at the expected ramp time. When the last aircraft is launching, or when given a “Signal Charlie” call from Tower, the flight will depart the holding pattern on a heading of approximately 210 degrees relative to BRC. As altitudes in the stack are vacated, aircraft at the next highest altitude will descend to the next lower vacated altitude.
Breaking the Deck - 
The majority of Case I operations are conducted under Zip Lip conditions, meaning that radio communications are minimized (unless CQ, low visibility, or safety of flight). In this situation, the Boss will not make a “99, Charlie” call on the radio; therefore, it is incumbent on aircraft holding overhead to determine when to depart holding, fly to the initial and break. The goal is to arrive in the groove just as the flight deck is made ready for recovery operations (ready deck). This is called breaking the deck and is a skill that must be mastered in order to maximize the efficiency of recovery operations. To effectively break the deck, aircraft in overhead holding will stagger their intervals to ensure equal spacing from all flights at the same altitude. If there are two total flights, then they should be 180-degrees apart. Three flights should be 120-degrees apart. Four flights will be 90-degrees apart. This ensures aircraft are crossing point 1 (Mother) at regular intervals. Each flight will observe the departure operations and determine whether or not to depart holding for the break at point 3.

Break -  When departing holding, the flight will descend outside of point 3 to 800 feet and proceed to the initial 3NM astern of the ship. The flight will continue inbound and fly just outboard the starboard side of the ship at 800 feet, paralleling BRC. Break altitude is 800 feet, and all breaks will be level. The break interval is determined by the last aircraft in the landing pattern. A 15-20 second break interval will correspond to a 40- 60 second landing interval.
No breaks will be performed more than 4 NM ahead of the ship. If you are unable to break before 4 NM, you will have to depart and reenter the pattern. To accomplish this, maintain 800 feet until 5 NM, then climb to 1,200 feet and execute a left-hand arc back to the initial. Tower must be notified of your intentions.

Carrier Landing Pattern - The carrier landing pattern is nearly identical to the landing pattern at the field. The biggest difference is that the 180 and Abeam positions are collocated at the carrier. Additionally, the downwind heading at the ship is the reciprocal of the BRC vice the landing heading (which will be approximately 10 degrees less than BRC due to the angled deck). CHAPTER TWO FLIGHT PROCEDURES 2-16 FLIGHT PROCEDURES When established on downwind, individual aircraft will descend to pattern altitude of 600 feet, perform landing checks and closely monitor the abeam distance. The carrier landing pattern is illustrated in the following image

Touch and Go/Bolter - The procedures for touch and go landings and bolters are identical. Continue to fly the ball all the way to touchdown. Upon touchdown, simultaneously advance power to MRT, retract speed brakes, and rotate to optimum AOA. Maintain wings level and verify a positive rate of climb and maintain optimum AOA. Once a positive rate of climb is established and your aircraft is abeam the bow, use a shallow right turn to parallel the BRC. Take interval on any aircraft that reaches the bow prior to you, either entering the break or launching off the cat. Climb to pattern altitude (600 feet) and turn downwind with proper intervals.

CAUTION
To avoid interfering with aircraft off the cat or in the break, do not cross the ship’s bow

Waveoff Pattern -  Waveoffs are MANDATORY. All waveoffs are made up the angled deck unless otherwise directed by the LSO or the tower (i.e. “waveoff starboard side”). All aircraft must comply with waveoff signals, whether they are verbal or solely with the waveoff lights on the lens. Waveoffs may result from a fouled deck, winds out of limits, or aircraft not being set up for a safe landing. To perform a waveoff, simultaneously advance power to MRT, retract speed brakes, maintain landing attitude (not to exceed optimum AOA), level wings, and climb up the angled deck. Verify a positive rate of climb and maintain optimum AOA. Once you have established a positive rate of climb and you are abeam the bow, use a shallow right turn to parallel the ship’s BRC. Climb to 600 feet and turn downwind with proper interval.

Communications - For Case I recoveries, Marshal will provide the case recovery, current BRC and expected “Charlie” time upon initial check in. Charlie time is the time at which launch operations are complete and recovery operations begin; additionally, Marshal will request notification when the carrier is in sight, normally around 10 NM. Sample communications are as follows:

405  		“Marshal, 405, 250 for 42, Angels 9, State 2.4”
Marshal  	“405, Case I. BRC is 015, Report, see me”
405  		“405, Wilco”

At 10 NM or when visual with the ship:

405  		“405, See you at 10”
Marshal  	“405, Switch Tower”

Once switched to Tower frequency, just monitor the frequency. The majority of Case I operations are conducted “Zip Lip.” This means that radio calls in the pattern are neither required nor desired. However, in low-visibility situations, the following calls will be made:

Descending out of overhead holding to the initial: 			                    “405, commencing”
Initial (3 NM astern): 							                                “405, initial”
Ball call, when rolling into the groove, and the pilot sees the ball: 		    “405, Hornet Ball, 2.2” 
where 2.2 is the fuel state. 
Clara when the ball is not visible:					                            “405, Clara”

Entering the spin pattern (when applicable): 			                    	“405, spinning”
90 degrees from initial when spinning: 				                        	“405, spin 90”
Departing the landing pattern to re-enter port holding: 		            	“405, Departing _____ NM, upwind”
Breaking - where X is the DME					                               	“405, breaking at X” 

During Zip Lip operations, the ball call will not be made. The LSO will acknowledge an implied ball call with a momentary flash of the cut lights (same as a “roger ball” call from the LSO) as the aircraft rolls into the groove. If the ball is not visible, a “clara” call will be made. At any time during Zip Lip operations, radio calls will be made for any safety of flight situations.

NOTE
Never transmit on the radio when another aircraft is on the ball, unless required for safety of flight.

## Case II Recovery:
Case II recoveries will be used when weather conditions are such that a flight may encounter IMC during the descent to the VFR pattern. The minimum weather requirements are 1,000 feet ceiling and 5 NM visibility. During Case II recoveries, formation flights are limited to two aircraft. Formations larger than two aircraft will have to be separated into smaller flights. During Case II, Case III procedures are used outside 10 NM and Case I procedures are used inside 10 NM, or after reporting “see you.” This approach will be flown until the ship is in sight, at which point, the flight will contact tower and proceed inbound as if Case I. If the flight does not see the ship by 5 NM, the aircraft will be vectored into the bolter/waveoff pattern and instructions will be given for a Case III recovery.

Marshal Holding -  If Marshal directs a Case II recovery, the flight will proceed to Case II/III marshal pattern holding fix. Ideally, the holding fix will be on the 180 radial relative to BRC. Weather and airspace considerations may not allow for this. Generally, the holding radial will be within 30 degrees of the 180 radial. Aircraft will hold on the assigned radial at a distance equal to 1 NM for every 1,000 feet of altitude plus 15. In other words, the distance of the holding fix is determined by adding 15 to the assigned holding altitude in angels. For example, if instructed to hold on the 220 radial at angels 8, the fix would be determined as follows: 

i. Distance = Angels + 15 = 8 +15 = 23 

Therefore, hold on the 220 radial at 23 DME at 8,000 feet. Image below  illustrates the Case II/III Marshal pattern. The lowest altitude for assignment is 6,000 feet for turboprop and jet aircraft.

## Case II/III Marshal Holding
The holding pattern is a six-minute left-hand pattern. Unless otherwise briefed, the pattern will be flown at max conserve fuel flow or NATOPS holding airspeed. Twominute turns and one-minute legs are normally used for the pattern. Aircraft must be established at assigned holding altitudes by 10 NM from the Marshal “stack.” Aircraft in the stack will be separated by 1,000 feet vertically. Strict management of the holding pattern is required to arrive at the fix, at the assigned approach time (push time). For example, arriving in holding at time 16 with a push time of 27, one 6-minute pattern and one 5-minute pattern could be used. But regardless of how the pattern is managed, aircraft must arrive at the holding fix on airspeed (250 kts) and ready to commence the approach at the Expected Approach Time (EAT) plus or minus 10 seconds. If unable to do this, notify Marshal so that timing adjustments to the landing interval can be made.

Approach -  Aircraft push times will normally be separated by one minute. Upon commencing the approach, aircraft will establish a 4,000 feet per minute rate of descent at 250 KIAS. At 5,000 feet (platform), the rate of descent will be reduced to 2,000 feet per minute. This will be maintained until reaching the level-off altitude of 1,200 feet. Aircraft will proceed inbound at 1,200 feet and report a “see me” when the ship is in sight. Marshal will switch the flight to Tower frequency for a normal Case I recovery. If the ship is not in sight by 10 NM, a descent to 800 feet is authorized. If the ship is still not in sight at 5 NM, notify Marshal for further instructions and vectors into the bolter/waveoff pattern for an instrument approach. The Case II approach profile is shown in image illustrated below.


## CASE II/III Approach
Communications - For Case II recoveries, Marshal will provide the following information upon check in:

Current weather and altimeter
Case recovery
Marshal instructions
Expected final approach button (frequency) if required
Expected approach time (EAT)
Expected BRC
Additional information such as divert field, fuel data and bingo information.

Notify Marshal when established in holding. Marshal may periodically update the weather and BRC. Notify Marshal when the approach is commenced. When the ship is in sight, the aircrew will call “see you” and Marshal will switch them to Tower. To reduce radio traffic, items of general or collective interest may be transmitted as a “99” broadcast by Marshal or approach control.

Sample communications are as follows:

405 - 		“Marshal, 405, 250 for 42, Angels 14, State 2.4”
Marshal - 	“405, Mother’s weather is 1,500 overcast, visibility 5 miles, altimeter 29.87. Case II recovery. Marshal on 
the 160, 22, angels 7. BRC is 015, Expected approach time 22.”
405 - 		“405, altimeter 29.87. Marshal on the 160, 22, angels 7. Expected approach time 22.”

When established in holding:
405 - 		“405, established angels 7. State 2.3”

While holding:
Marshal - 	“99, altimeter 29.88. BRC 020”

When beginning the penetration:
405 - 		“405 commencing, 29.88, State 2.2”

When visual with the ship:
405 - 		“405, see you at 12”
Marshal -	 “405, switch Tower”
405 - 		“405, switching Tower”

Approaching the initial with nobody on the ball:
405 - 		“Tower, 405 initial”
Tower - 		“405, roger”

Normal Case I calls will be made in the landing pattern.

3.4 Case III Recovery:

The Case III recovery is used for all night operations, as well as during the day when the weather is below Case II minimums (less than 1,000-3). Case III recoveries are limited to single aircraft only. Section approaches will be approved only when an aircraft emergency situation exists. Formation penetrations/approaches by dissimilar aircraft shall not be attempted except in extreme circumstances when no safer options are available for recovery.

Holding - The Case III marshal holding pattern is identical to Case II. During Case III recoveries, aircraft will commence from the Marshal stack and fly the CV-1 Approach.

The Case III recovery is used for all night operations, as well as during the day when the weather is below Case II minimums (less than 1,000-3). Case III recoveries are limited to single aircraft only. Section approaches will be approved only when an aircraft emergency situation exists. Formation penetrations/approaches by dissimilar aircraft shall not be attempted except in extreme circumstances when no safer options are available for recovery.

Holding. The Case III marshal holding pattern is identical to Case II. During Case III recoveries, aircraft will commence from the Marshal stack and fly the CV-1 Approach.

Approach - The CV-1 Approach is illustrated in Figure 2-8. Aircraft push times will normally be separated by one minute. Upon commencing the approach, aircraft will establish a 4,000 feet per minute rate of descent at 250 KIAS. If the Marshal radial is not the reciprocal of the final bearing, a correction to final bearing will be required at 20 DME as follows:

A gradual correction shall be made when the final bearing is within 10° of the reciprocal of the marshal radial.
A 30° correction at 20 DME will be used when the final bearing is greater than 10° from the reciprocal of the 
marshal radial. If not established on the final bearing by 12 miles, fly the 12-mile arc until intercepting final 
bearing.

At 5,000 feet (platform), the rate of descent will be reduced to 2,000 feet per minute. This will be maintained until reaching the level-off altitude of 1,200 feet. At some point during the penetration or level off, Marshal will switch the aircrew to the final approach control frequency and they will check in with altitude. Landing checks will be initiated at 10 DME, and aircraft will reduce speed to cross 6 DME at 150 kts. Landing gear should be down no later than 8 DME. At 6 DME, aircraft will slow to final approach speed. ACLS lock-on will occur sometime between 8 DME and 4 DME. At lock-on, compare the needles with bullseye (ACLS to ICLS) to ensure a good lock. Approach will ask the crew to “say needles.” The pilot will reply with the relative position of both the glideslope needle and the azimuth needle, such as “fly up, fly right” or “fly up, on.” If this concurs with the readout on the approach radar scope, the controller will direct, “fly the needles.” If there is a disagreement, the controller will break lock and attempt a new lock. In this case, he will say “fly the bullseye” (ICLS) until he acquires a new ACLS lock.

Once a good ACLS lock has been confirmed, the pilot will fly the needles. As a backup, always perform a self-contained GCA, comparing actual altitude with calculated altitude as follows:

3 NM 		1,200 feet 
2 NM 		800 feet 
1 NM 		400 feet 
0.5 NM 		200 feet 

At 3/4-mile, the final controller will instruct aircrew to call the ball. The LSOs will roger the ball call. Continue to monitor the approach as the pilot transitions from an inside to outside scan.

Bolter/Waveoff Pattern -  In the event of a waveoff or bolter, climb to 1,200 feet at 150 kts and raise the gear to save fuel, leaving flaps down. When instructed by approach, turn downwind. Perform the landing checks on downwind, and notify approach with fuel state when abeam the ship. Expect a turn back to final 4-8 NM past abeam for another approach, lowering the landing gear as you start this turn to final.

If no instructions are received by 4 DME upwind, attempt to contact approach. If unable to contact approach, turn downwind and perform the normal checks. Make the abeam call, and if contact has not been reestablished with approach by 4 NM (2 minutes) past abeam, turn final. Intercept the ICLS and fly a normal approach. Call the ball at 3/4-mile. If this call is not acknowledged, look for the cut lights.

Communications - For Case III recoveries, Marshal will provide the following information upon check in:

1. Current weather and altimeter
2. Case recovery
3. Marshal instructions
4. Expected final approach button (frequency)
5. Expected approach time (EAT)
6. Expected final bearing
7. Additional information such as divert field, fuel data and bingo information.

Notify Marshal when established in holding. Marshal may periodically update the weather and BRC while in holding.
Notify Marshal when the approach is commenced. Marshal will hand aircraft off to the final controller during the penetration, ideally before reaching platform.

Sample communications are as follows:

405  		“Marshal, 405, 250 for 42, Angels 14, State 2.4”
Marshal  	                                        “405, Mother’s weather is 600 overcast, visibility 3 miles, altimeter 29.87. Case III recovery, CV-1

405  		                                        “405 switching button 18

Check in with Approach/tow:
405  		                                        “405 checking in, state 1.5”
