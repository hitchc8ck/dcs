1.0 Internal Operations
1.1 ATO, Briefing, Debrief
All the members make sure that they are listed in the ATO on their own discretion on Saturday Night.
If one shows up 1730/1830 Zulu (respectively Winter/Summertime) without being listed, chances are, to a degree, that they will not have a plane on the deck to fly.
It is mandatory that all division leaders, wingmen, and section leaders pre-brief themselves prior to the briefing at 1730/1830 Zulu.
Obviously if questions arise, ask at any time, even during the briefing itself.
During the brief and debrief, we want that the flight lead and wingmen can brief without interruption.
Make sure to have all mods prior to the briefing installed and working. There will be no ‘’questions’’ regarding what specific mods are needed. All are needed.

1.2 Missions outside the Campaign, involving work-ups

Our frequent work ups are just as important as any of the campaign missions we fly.
As far as our operational strength is concerned, they are even more important than our regular hops in our campaigns.
It is important that all the members can join the missions as often as they can.

1.3 Skins, Modex and division callsigns

The skins used/made are connected to the Modex and personal callsigns and are established per squadron.
The jets will be preset per Modex and skins for every mission in workups and cruises and are meant to be maintained.
Division callsigns are defined in the ATO

1.4 Personal callsigns for each JO, (XO/CO included)

In VFA-89 we have a tradition that goes way back to mid-2018 and has its origin in military aviation history from the late 1960s onwards to date.
*When a Nugget gets aboard, he will keep his nickname till further notice.
**Once the Nugget has proven to be reliable, shows up regularly, maintains a steady learning curve, has an attitude similar to the JO’s, and seems like a good sport, he may end up with a callsign sooner or later.

* and ** may or may not be considered if the opportunity is too convenient for a callsign of the JO's in question.

The callsigns are irrevocable by the ones that have received them
Callsigns are not meant to be demeaning but are 50% of the time.
Prohibited references:
No reference from real live facts, birth certificate related items
No reference from their looks
No reference regarding their origin (country, language, skin color)
The callsign will be signed off and given by the discord maintainer due to it being our platform.
Callsigns can be defined and influenced by JO’s and else.
The definition by which means a callsign can be defined are limitless in respect of prohibited references









1.5 Presence requirements

-Once a member does not fly for 4 weeks he gets asked to hand in a waiver if/when they start flying again, can be a specific date or in weeks.
Unless they hand in the waiver on their own at any time.

-The waiver lasts for a maximum time of 4 weeks from the time they hand the waiver in.
-The waiver has to be a discord DM to CO or XO

-If no waiver gets handed in 1 week after the 4th week is skipped, the pilot gets discharged and can reapply for a pilot slot.
If the member has been a JO previously he will fly a checkride in A/S, A/A and CQ.
In case the pilot gets discharged during his nugget tour they'll start over from the beginning.

-Once the max. of 4 waived weeks elapsed they get another week to resume flying, if they don't do so, the pilot gets discharged and can reapply for a pilot slot.
If the member has been a JO previously he will fly a checkride in A/S, A/A and CQ.
In case the pilot gets discharged during his nugget tour they'll start over from the beginning.

If the discharged pilot has not reapplied for a pilot slot 6 months after being discharged, they have to go through the VFA-89 Syllabus.

2.0 CARRIER Departure Procedure

2.1 Case I Departure

This departure may be utilized when it is anticipated that flights will not encounter instrument conditions during
departures and rendezvous with weather conditions no lower than 3,000 feet and 5 nm visibility.

Line up at the Catapult and Launch:
Lead aircraft will line up first, the wingmen will line up on other available Catapults, if none available, line up behind the JBD (Jet Blast Deflector). Preferred catapults if free is in the following order:

CAT I		Lead 1-1
CAT II		Section Lead 1-3
CAT III		Wingman 1-2
CAT IV		Wingman 1-4

After the lead got Take-Off Clearance he will announce “spooling up” and when his wingman on CAT III is also at 80% RPM and both called out “in the green” Lead announces “Full Afterburner”  both engage lights and go full AB, do a quick full deflection of all control surfaces to have deck crew observe correct working controls, center stick and launch will start within a few seconds.

Notes: 
CAT I + CAT III and CAT II + CAT IV can takeoff together 
Between CAT I and CAT II or CAT III and CAT IV launches is a separation of minimum 20(30 IRL) seconds required 




After Launch from the Catapult CASE I:
After a clearing turn, proceed straight ahead paralleling the BRC at 500 feet until 7 DME. Aircraft are then cleared to
climb unrestricted in visual conditions.



Clearing Turn:
A clearing turn is executed to create upwind separation between departing aircraft and aircraft remaining in the landing pattern. It also serves as a visual signal of the aircraft’s intent to depart the carrier. A clearing turn shall be executed during all case I and II launches when the aircraft is departing the carrier. Clearing turns shall be made to the right off the bow catapults  and to the left off the waist catapults for 20 degrees of heading chang followed by a reversal of turn to parallel the BRC. Clearing turns shall not be executed by aircraft during case III launches or when the aircraft intends to remain in the landing pattern.



Launch Frequencies: Aircraft shall normally launch on the departure frequency that shall be monitored by the tower.

2.2 Case II Departure: 

For departure, visual conditions at the ship may exist down to a ceiling of 1,000 feet and visibility of 5 miles. Launch
shall be on departure control frequency.

Line up at the Catapult and Launch:
Lead aircraft will line up first, the wingmen will line up on other available Catapults, if none available, line up behind the JBD (Jet Blast Deflector). After the lead got Take Off Clearance he will go Full Afterburner power, do a quick full deflection of all control surfaces to have deck crew observe correct working controls, center stick and launch will start within a few seconds.

After Launch from the Catapult CASE II:
After a clearing turn, proceed straight ahead at 500 feet paralleling the BRC. At 7 DME, turn to intercept the 10-nm
arc, maintaining visual conditions until established on the departure radial. The 500-foot restriction is lifted after
7 nm if the climb can be continued in visual conditions. Jets shall maintain 300 knots until VMC on top.



2.3 Case III Departure:

This departure shall be used whenever existing weather at the ship is below Case II departure minimums and during
all night operations except as modified by the OTC or commanding officer. Case III departures are compatible only
with Case III recoveries. The launch shall be on departure control frequency. A minimum launch interval of
30 seconds shall be used between aircraft. When possible, a 60-second interval will be provided when launching a
jet aircraft following a turboprop.

Line up at the Catapult and Launch:
Lead aircraft will line up first, the wingmen will line up on other available Catapults, if none available, line up behind the JBD (Jet Blast Deflector). After the lead got Take Off clearance and when the pilot is ready, he turns on his Navigation Lights to STEADY to signal he is prepared for launch. Then go Full Afterburner power, do a quick full deflection of all control surfaces to have deck crew observe correct working controls, center stick and launch will start within a few seconds.

After Launch from the Catapult CASE III:
Climb straight ahead accelerating at 300 knots crossing 5 nm at 1,500 feet or above. At 7 DME, execute turn to fly the 10-nm arc until intercepting the briefed departure radial.

3.0 CARRIER RECOVERY PROCEDURES

3.1 ARRIVAL AND RECOVERY

Following the mission, aircraft will proceed back to Mother to arrive at their scheduled cyclic land time. After checking out on the mission frequency, contact the CSG air defense controller (Red Crown) with your call sign, position and altitude. Red Crown will pass instructions, and then hand you off to Strike Control. This hand off should occur prior to entering the 50 NM Carrier Control Area (CCA). The check in with Strike will be the same as for Red Crown except you will also include the low fuel state in your flight. If any aircraft in the flight have maintenance discrepancies (“alibis”), pass them to the Strike controller who will then relay them to the ready room. Time permitting; Strike will give the current weather, anticipated Case recovery and any other general information for the recovery.

Once inside the CCA, Strike will hand aircraft off to the Marshal controller. Check in on Marshal Frequency with call sign, position, altitude and low state. Marshal will assign case recovery holding instructions (including assigned altitude) and pass the ship’s weather, altimeter setting, BRC and bingo information. BRC is the ship’s heading during the recovery.

For Case I recoveries, Marshal will clear aircraft to the overhead holding pattern and instruct you to call “see me” at 10NM from the ship. This call indicates you have visual contact with Mother. For Case II and III recoveries, Marshal will give holding instructions and an expected approach time (push time).

Note

VFA 89 will conduct this on the primary Mother radio channel, in real life there are a minimum of 4 people/radios needed.


Example radio calls: Blue = Aircraft - Red = Mother, Marshal, Paddles, LSO, etc. - [lines] are not used

[405 		 “Red Crown, 405, Mother’s 250 for 75, Angels 17” ]
[Red Crown 	 “405, sweet/sweet, contact Strike” ]

[405 		“Strike, 405, Mother’s 250 for 55, Angels 12, State 2.4. No alibis” ]
[Strike 		“405, sweet/sweetä, Mother is VFR, Case I is in effect. Contact Marshal” ]

405 		 “Marshal, 405, 250 for 52, Angels 9, State 2.4”
Marshal 	 “405, Case I. BRC is 015, Expected Charlie time 22. Report see me”

or

Marshal		“405, Case II (or III) in effect. BRC is 015. Marshal on the 245 radial at 25 DME, Angels 10. Expected 
approach time 22, Approach button 17, altimeter 29.94”



Marshal Arrival Information:

The flight leader shall provide the following information when checking in with Marshal Control:
1. Position
2. Altitude
3. Fuel state (low state in flight)
4. Total number of aircraft in flight (lineup)
5. Type approach requested — UTMs sweet (if applicable)
6. Other pertinent information such as navigational aid status, hung or unexpended ordnance, weather, etc., that
may affect recovery




3.2 CASE I Recovery: 

Case I recoveries are used to the maximum extent possible, provided the weather is better than 3,000/5.


Overhead (Port) Holding 

After the initial check in with Marshal, proceed directly to Mother and enter overhead holding at your squadron’s holding altitude. When in visual contact with Mother, notify Marshal with the “see you” call. Aircraft returning for Case I recoveries must be established at their respective holding altitudes no later than 10 NM. Proceed to overhead holding, and enter the pattern tangentially.





















The overhead holding pattern is a left-hand pattern, with Point 1 located directly overhead the carrier. Points 2, 3 and 4 sequentially follow in 90-degree increments . This holding pattern is often referred to as the “stack,” and all aircraft must remain within 5 NM and no lower than 2,000 feet AGL. While holding, the flight will remain at max conserve fuel flow unless briefed otherwise.

Each squadron has an assigned holding altitude in the stack, beginning at 2,000 feet AGL. These assigned altitudes are separated vertically by a minimum of 1,000 feet and are assigned by the CVW SOP. Once established in holding, any altitude changes within the pattern are accomplished as follows:
 
Climbs: Performed between points 1 and 3. 
Descents: Performed between points 3 and 1.

The lowest aircraft in the stack must closely monitor the launch so as to arrive in the groove at the expected ramp time. When the last aircraft is launching, or when given a “Signal Charlie” call from Tower, the flight will depart the holding pattern on a heading of approximately 210 degrees relative to BRC. As altitudes in the stack are vacated, aircraft at the next highest altitude will descend to the next lower vacated altitude.
















Breaking the Deck - 
The majority of Case I operations are conducted under Zip Lip conditions, meaning that radio communications are minimized (unless CQ, low visibility, or safety of flight). In this situation, the Boss will not make a “99, Charlie” call on the radio; therefore, it is incumbent on aircraft holding overhead to determine when to depart holding, fly to the initial and break. The goal is to arrive in the groove just as the flight deck is made ready for recovery operations (ready deck). This is called breaking the deck and is a skill that must be mastered in order to maximize the efficiency of recovery operations. To effectively break the deck, aircraft in overhead holding will stagger their intervals to ensure equal spacing from all flights at the same altitude. If there are two total flights, then they should be 180-degrees apart. Three flights should be 120-degrees apart. Four flights will be 90-degrees apart. This ensures aircraft are crossing point 1 (Mother) at regular intervals. Each flight will observe the departure operations and determine whether or not to depart holding for the break at point 3.












Break -  When departing holding, the flight will descend outside of point 3 to 800 feet and proceed to the initial 3NM astern of the ship. The flight will continue inbound and fly just outboard the starboard side of the ship at 800 feet, paralleling BRC. Break altitude is 800 feet, and all breaks will be level. The break interval is determined by the last aircraft in the landing pattern. A 15-20 second break interval will correspond to a 40- 60 second landing interval.
No breaks will be performed more than 4 NM ahead of the ship. If you are unable to break before 4 NM, you will have to depart and reenter the pattern. To accomplish this, maintain 800 feet until 5 NM, then climb to 1,200 feet and execute a left-hand arc back to the initial. Tower must be notified of your intentions.


Carrier Landing Pattern - The carrier landing pattern is nearly identical to the landing pattern at the field. The biggest difference is that the 180 and Abeam positions are collocated at the carrier. Additionally, the downwind heading at the ship is the reciprocal of the BRC vice the landing heading (which will be approximately 10 degrees less than BRC due to the angled deck). CHAPTER TWO FLIGHT PROCEDURES 2-16 FLIGHT PROCEDURES When established on downwind, individual aircraft will descend to pattern altitude of 600 feet, perform landing checks and closely monitor the abeam distance. The carrier landing pattern is illustrated in the following image


Touch and Go/Bolter - The procedures for touch and go landings and bolters are identical. Continue to fly the ball all the way to touchdown. Upon touchdown, simultaneously advance power to MRT, retract speed brakes, and rotate to optimum AOA. Maintain wings level and verify a positive rate of climb and maintain optimum AOA. Once a positive rate of climb is established and your aircraft is abeam the bow, use a shallow right turn to parallel the BRC. Take interval on any aircraft that reaches the bow prior to you, either entering the break or launching off the cat. Climb to pattern altitude (600 feet) and turn downwind with proper intervals.
CAUTION

To avoid interfering with aircraft off the cat or in the break, do not cross the ship’s bow

Waveoff Pattern -  Waveoffs are MANDATORY. All waveoffs are made up the angled deck unless otherwise directed by the LSO or the tower (i.e. “waveoff starboard side”). All aircraft must comply with waveoff signals, whether they are verbal or solely with the waveoff lights on the lens. Waveoffs may result from a fouled deck, winds out of limits, or aircraft not being set up for a safe landing. To perform a waveoff, simultaneously advance power to MRT, retract speed brakes, maintain landing attitude (not to exceed optimum AOA), level wings, and climb up the angled deck. Verify a positive rate of climb and maintain optimum AOA. Once you have established a positive rate of climb and you are abeam the bow, use a shallow right turn to parallel the ship’s BRC. Climb to 600 feet and turn downwind with proper interval.

Communications - For Case I recoveries, Marshal will provide the case recovery, current BRC and expected “Charlie” time upon initial check in. Charlie time is the time at which launch operations are complete and recovery operations begin; additionally, Marshal will request notification when the carrier is in sight, normally around 10 NM. Sample communications are as follows:

405  		“Marshal, 405, 250 for 42, Angels 9, State 2.4”
Marshal  	“405, Case I. BRC is 015, Report, see me”
405  		“405, Wilco”

At 10 NM or when visual with the ship:

405  		“405, See you at 10”
Marshal  	“405, Switch Tower”

Once switched to Tower frequency, just monitor the frequency. The majority of Case I operations are conducted “Zip Lip.” This means that radio calls in the pattern are neither required nor desired. However, in low-visibility situations, the following calls will be made:

Descending out of overhead holding to the initial: 			“405, commencing”
Initial (3 NM astern): 							“405, initial”
Ball call, when rolling into the groove, and the pilot sees the ball: 		“405, Hornet Ball, 2.2” 
where 2.2 is the fuel state. 
Clara when the ball is not visible:					“405, Clara”

Entering the spin pattern (when applicable): 				“405, spinning”
90 degrees from initial when spinning: 					“405, spin 90”
Departing the landing pattern to re-enter port holding: 			“405, Departing _____ NM, upwind”
Breaking - where X is the DME						“405, breaking at X” 


During Zip Lip operations, the ball call will not be made. The LSO will acknowledge an implied ball call with a momentary flash of the cut lights (same as a “roger ball” call from the LSO) as the aircraft rolls into the groove. If the ball is not visible, a “clara” call will be made. At any time during Zip Lip operations, radio calls will be made for any safety of flight situations.






NOTE

Never transmit on the radio when another aircraft is on the ball, unless required for safety of flight.

3.3 Case II Recovery:

Case II recoveries will be used when weather conditions are such that a flight may encounter IMC during the descent to the VFR pattern. The minimum weather requirements are 1,000 feet ceiling and 5 NM visibility. During Case II recoveries, formation flights are limited to two aircraft. Formations larger than two aircraft will have to be separated into smaller flights. During Case II, Case III procedures are used outside 10 NM and Case I procedures are used inside 10 NM, or after reporting “see you.” This approach will be flown until the ship is in sight, at which point, the flight will contact tower and proceed inbound as if Case I. If the flight does not see the ship by 5 NM, the aircraft will be vectored into the bolter/waveoff pattern and instructions will be given for a Case III recovery.

Marshal Holding -  If Marshal directs a Case II recovery, the flight will proceed to Case II/III marshal pattern holding fix. Ideally, the holding fix will be on the 180 radial relative to BRC. Weather and airspace considerations may not allow for this. Generally, the holding radial will be within 30 degrees of the 180 radial. Aircraft will hold on the assigned radial at a distance equal to 1 NM for every 1,000 feet of altitude plus 15. In other words, the distance of the holding fix is determined by adding 15 to the assigned holding altitude in angels. For example, if instructed to hold on the 220 radial at angels 8, the fix would be determined as follows: 

i. Distance = Angels + 15 = 8 +15 = 23 

Therefore, hold on the 220 radial at 23 DME at 8,000 feet. Image below  illustrates the Case II/III Marshal pattern. The lowest altitude for assignment is 6,000 feet for turboprop and jet aircraft.


Case II/III Marshal Holding


The holding pattern is a six-minute left-hand pattern. Unless otherwise briefed, the pattern will be flown at max conserve fuel flow or NATOPS holding airspeed. Twominute turns and one-minute legs are normally used for the pattern. Aircraft must be established at assigned holding altitudes by 10 NM from the Marshal “stack.” Aircraft in the stack will be separated by 1,000 feet vertically. Strict management of the holding pattern is required to arrive at the fix, at the assigned approach time (push time). For example, arriving in holding at time 16 with a push time of 27, one 6-minute pattern and one 5-minute pattern could be used. But regardless of how the pattern is managed, aircraft must arrive at the holding fix on airspeed (250 kts) and ready to commence the approach at the Expected Approach Time (EAT) plus or minus 10 seconds. If unable to do this, notify Marshal so that timing adjustments to the landing interval can be made.

Approach -  Aircraft push times will normally be separated by one minute. Upon commencing the approach, aircraft will establish a 4,000 feet per minute rate of descent at 250 KIAS. At 5,000 feet (platform), the rate of descent will be reduced to 2,000 feet per minute. This will be maintained until reaching the level-off altitude of 1,200 feet. Aircraft will proceed inbound at 1,200 feet and report a “see me” when the ship is in sight. Marshal will switch the flight to Tower frequency for a normal Case I recovery. If the ship is not in sight by 10 NM, a descent to 800 feet is authorized. If the ship is still not in sight at 5 NM, notify Marshal for further instructions and vectors into the bolter/waveoff pattern for an instrument approach. The Case II approach profile is shown in image illustrated below.


CASE II/III Approach



Communications - For Case II recoveries, Marshal will provide the following information upon check in:

Current weather and altimeter
Case recovery
Marshal instructions
Expected final approach button (frequency) if required
Expected approach time (EAT)
Expected BRC
Additional information such as divert field, fuel data and bingo information.

Notify Marshal when established in holding. Marshal may periodically update the weather and BRC. Notify Marshal when the approach is commenced. When the ship is in sight, the aircrew will call “see you” and Marshal will switch them to Tower. To reduce radio traffic, items of general or collective interest may be transmitted as a “99” broadcast by Marshal or approach control.

Sample communications are as follows:

405 - 		“Marshal, 405, 250 for 42, Angels 14, State 2.4”
Marshal - 	“405, Mother’s weather is 1,500 overcast, visibility 5 miles, altimeter 29.87. Case II recovery. Marshal on 
the 160, 22, angels 7. BRC is 015, Expected approach time 22.”
405 - 		“405, altimeter 29.87. Marshal on the 160, 22, angels 7. Expected approach time 22.”

When established in holding:
405 - 		“405, established angels 7. State 2.3”

While holding:
Marshal - 	“99, altimeter 29.88. BRC 020”

When beginning the penetration:
405 - 		“405 commencing, 29.88, State 2.2”

When visual with the ship:
405 - 		“405, see you at 12”
Marshal -	 “405, switch Tower”
405 - 		“405, switching Tower”

Approaching the initial with nobody on the ball:
405 - 		“Tower, 405 initial”
Tower - 		“405, roger”

Normal Case I calls will be made in the landing pattern.




























3.4 Case III Recovery:

The Case III recovery is used for all night operations, as well as during the day when the weather is below Case II minimums (less than 1,000-3). Case III recoveries are limited to single aircraft only. Section approaches will be approved only when an aircraft emergency situation exists. Formation penetrations/approaches by dissimilar aircraft shall not be attempted except in extreme circumstances when no safer options are available for recovery.

Holding - The Case III marshal holding pattern is identical to Case II. During Case III recoveries, aircraft will commence from the Marshal stack and fly the CV-1 Approach.

The Case III recovery is used for all night operations, as well as during the day when the weather is below Case II minimums (less than 1,000-3). Case III recoveries are limited to single aircraft only. Section approaches will be approved only when an aircraft emergency situation exists. Formation penetrations/approaches by dissimilar aircraft shall not be attempted except in extreme circumstances when no safer options are available for recovery.

Holding. The Case III marshal holding pattern is identical to Case II. During Case III recoveries, aircraft will commence from the Marshal stack and fly the CV-1 Approach.

Approach - The CV-1 Approach is illustrated in Figure 2-8. Aircraft push times will normally be separated by one minute. Upon commencing the approach, aircraft will establish a 4,000 feet per minute rate of descent at 250 KIAS. If the Marshal radial is not the reciprocal of the final bearing, a correction to final bearing will be required at 20 DME as follows:

A gradual correction shall be made when the final bearing is within 10° of the reciprocal of the marshal radial.
A 30° correction at 20 DME will be used when the final bearing is greater than 10° from the reciprocal of the 
marshal radial. If not established on the final bearing by 12 miles, fly the 12-mile arc until intercepting final 
bearing.

At 5,000 feet (platform), the rate of descent will be reduced to 2,000 feet per minute. This will be maintained until reaching the level-off altitude of 1,200 feet. At some point during the penetration or level off, Marshal will switch the aircrew to the final approach control frequency and they will check in with altitude. Landing checks will be initiated at 10 DME, and aircraft will reduce speed to cross 6 DME at 150 kts. Landing gear should be down no later than 8 DME. At 6 DME, aircraft will slow to final approach speed. ACLS lock-on will occur sometime between 8 DME and 4 DME. At lock-on, compare the needles with bullseye (ACLS to ICLS) to ensure a good lock. Approach will ask the crew to “say needles.” The pilot will reply with the relative position of both the glideslope needle and the azimuth needle, such as “fly up, fly right” or “fly up, on.” If this concurs with the readout on the approach radar scope, the controller will direct, “fly the needles.” If there is a disagreement, the controller will break lock and attempt a new lock. In this case, he will say “fly the bullseye” (ICLS) until he acquires a new ACLS lock.



Once a good ACLS lock has been confirmed, the pilot will fly the needles. As a backup, always perform a self-contained GCA, comparing actual altitude with calculated altitude as follows:

3 NM 		1,200 feet 
2 NM 		800 feet 
1 NM 		400 feet 
0.5 NM 		200 feet 

At 3/4-mile, the final controller will instruct aircrew to call the ball. The LSOs will roger the ball call. Continue to monitor the approach as the pilot transitions from an inside to outside scan.



Bolter/Waveoff Pattern -  In the event of a waveoff or bolter, climb to 1,200 feet at 150 kts and raise the gear to save fuel, leaving flaps down. When instructed by approach, turn downwind. Perform the landing checks on downwind, and notify approach with fuel state when abeam the ship. Expect a turn back to final 4-8 NM past abeam for another approach, lowering the landing gear as you start this turn to final.

If no instructions are received by 4 DME upwind, attempt to contact approach. If unable to contact approach, turn downwind and perform the normal checks. Make the abeam call, and if contact has not been reestablished with approach by 4 NM (2 minutes) past abeam, turn final. Intercept the ICLS and fly a normal approach. Call the ball at 3/4-mile. If this call is not acknowledged, look for the cut lights.

Communications - For Case III recoveries, Marshal will provide the following information upon check in:

Current weather and altimeter
Case recovery
Marshal instructions
Expected final approach button (frequency)
Expected approach time (EAT)
Expected final bearing
Additional information such as divert field, fuel data and bingo information.


Notify Marshal when established in holding. Marshal may periodically update the weather and BRC while in holding.
Notify Marshal when the approach is commenced. Marshal will hand aircraft off to the final controller during the penetration, ideally before reaching platform.











Sample communications are as follows:

405  		“Marshal, 405, 250 for 42, Angels 14, State 2.4”
Marshal  	“405, Mother’s weather is 600 overcast, visibility 3 miles, altimeter 29.87. Case III recovery, CV-1
approach. Marshal on the 160, 22, angels 7. Expected final bearing 015, expected approach time 22. 
Approach button 18.”
405  		“405, altimeter 29.87. Marshal on the 160, 22, angels 7. Expected approach time 22.”

When established in holding:
405 		 “405, established angels 7. State 2.3”

While holding:

4.0 AIR TO AIR REFUELING PROCEDURES


4.1 TYPES OF REFUELING


Force Extension in Transit - In short this is where a Tanker flies in company with other aircraft which has a shorter endurance to refuel them or top them up in flight. The Tanker may fly all or some of the entire route with the aircraft they are escorting. This is often done when fighters are transiting from one theatre to another and don’t have the ferry tank space available to complete the entire flight in one go. The Fighter/Striker Squadrons’ maintenance teams and various stores may also be carried on the Tanker in their transport capacity. The Tanker’s flight may commence and complete at different AFB’s.


Anchor Point and Tanker Lane - This is where a Tanker will orbit a particular location, using a Waypoint as an anchor point and when joined by an aircraft for refueling it will then proceed along a dedicated Tanker Lane for the refueling operation. In this set up the Tanker will most likely return to their home base on completion of operations. There are various different ways of arranging an RVP (Rendezvous Point).


The standard refueling anchor has three parts: 
Anchor
Air Refueling Initial Point (ARIP) 
Air Refueling Control Point (ARCP)


The refueling anchor is normally a left-hand racetrack pattern flown by the Tanker. The dimensions of an anchor can be adjusted to meet local airspace requirements and restrictions. Prior to working in an anchor, the WD should refer to local airspace maps and become familiar with the anchor. The anchor will normally have legs of approximately 50nm in length based on a specific Air Refueling Contact Point (ARCP). The ARCP and the Air Refueling Initial Point (ARIP) are used by receiver pilots and Tanker navigators to coordinate join-ups without the assistance of tactical control from GCI/AWACS. The ARCP is the planned geographic point over which the receivers arrive in the observation or precontact position with respect to the assigned Tanker. The air tasking order (ATO) will define an air refueling contact time (ARCT), which is the planned time that the receiver and tanker will arrive over the ARCP. Knowing the ARCT can help determine the flow of receivers and aid in planning for unscheduled receivers.


4.2 PROCEDURES ON JOINING

The aircraft that wish to refuel, do not have to contact the Tanker ATC Control Area until they are close to the Tanker.
The aircraft themselves are responsible for aircraft deconfliction. 

Form up on the LEFT side wing of the Tanker in the OBSERVATION AREA in an Echelon Left Formation
The first (lead) aircraft then positions itself behind the Tanker and starts to refuel
After the first aircraft is ready, he forms up on the RIGHT side wing of the Tanker in the REFORM AREA
The second aircraft then proceeds via the same procedure from step 2
Once the second aircraft is ready with fueling, he then forms up on the RIGHT wing of the lead, effectively establishing an Echelon Right Formation

5.0 JTAC/FAC/FAC(a) by Miyagi -  Original 

Joint Terminal Attack Controller / Forward Air Controller (airborne) in DCS

5.1 Definition

Forward air control is the provision of guidance to close air support (CAS) aircraft intended to ensure that their attack hits the intended target and does not injure friendly troops. This task is carried out by a forward air controller (FAC). Since 2003 the United States Armed Forces have used the term joint terminal attack controller (JTAC) for some of their ground based FACs.

FACs may form part of a Fire Support Team or Tactical Air Control Party, they may be ground based, airborne FACs in fixed-wing aircraft (FAC-A) or in helicopters (ABFAC).

Duties

Knowing the enemy situation, selected targets & location of friendly / civilian units
Knowing the commander’s and supported unit’s plans, position and needs
Provide TAC (Tactical Air Control) with supported commander’s approval
Locating targets of opportunity
Requesting & controlling airstrikes
Deconflict aircraft and fires from CAS sorties
Performing battle damage assessment (BDA)
Prevent fratricide

5.2 Close Air Support (CAS)

In military tactics, CAS is defined as air action such as air strikes by fixed or rotary-winged aircraft against hostile targets that are in proximity to friendly forces and which requires detailed integration of each air mission with fire and movement of these forces and attacks with aerial bombs, glide bombs, missiles, rockets, aircraft cannons, machine guns, and even directed-energy weapons such as lasers.

The requirement for detailed integration because of proximity, fires or movement is the determining factor. In advanced modern militaries, this coordination is typically handled by specialists such as Joint Fires Observers (JFOs), Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs), and forward air controllers (FACs).

Requesting Close Air Support and applicability in DCS

With the whole process of requesting CAS in the real world being a highly complex, integrated process that requires communication and coordination from various agencies, in DCS we can concentrate on the steps following after aircraft are actually airborne to be part of the CAS stack - in the following illustration, these are steps 9 - 15.


5.3 Attacking Aircraft - Concepts and Operations

Flight Lead is the one primarily talking to ASOC/TACP/JTAC
Flight Lead should delegate inter-flight jobs (orbit, altitude etc.) to relieve his workload
Flight members must pay attention to ASOC/TACP/JTAC comms and get as much info as possible, as long as it is safe to do so
Flight members must be aware of all the information prior to attack. Acquiring missing information or correlation should be done with/against Flight Lead

5.4 Orbits and Patterns

At various points of the CAS stack, flights will have to orbit either at contact points, holding areas or initial points, with the orbit location and type being specified by ASOC/TACP/JTAC.

Orbits can be over Contact Point (CP), Holding Area (HA) or Initial Point (IP)
Orbit location will be specified by ASOC/TACP/JTAC
Orbit type can be requested by ASOC/TACP/JTAC, else it is up to Flight Lead to select the most appropriate type

Orbit types:



5.5 Checking in as part of the CAS stack

Either being scrambled as alert aircraft or part of a predefined CAS element, the flight needs to check in with ASOC/TACP/JTAC as briefed or as dictated by circumstance.

Check-In will be performed by Flight Lead at CP (contact point)
Flight will wait for “ready check-in” call before starting actual check-in
Flight will pass concentrated information of it’s status including laser codes, if applicable
Information passed will include the following:
Mission number as briefed
Number and type of aircraft
Position
Ordnance
Playtime
Abort Code
Remarks
Remarks include special qualifications, sensors, SADL, LINK16 etc.

After Check-In, ASOC/TACP/JTAC will provide AO / Situation Update if required

AO update will include
Threat(s)
Target(s)
Friendlies
Artillery
Ordnance
Remarks/Restrictions

During the AO update, JTAC will provide the flight with target location in the so-called “Keyhole” format:

Keyhole is an efficient method for establishing an IP in the absence of control points, or when their location does not sufficiently support target engagement
JTAC will pass in AO update an “Echo” point, typically the target and either anchor the flight to their hold point based off the Echo point with a direction and distance in nautical miles
Coordinates can either be LL / MGRS or offsets from predetermined locations (Bullseye, Landmarks)
Aircraft should hold outside the distance given
The standard Keyhole format is to label each of the cardinal directions with a letter:
A - north
B - east
C - south
D - west
E - overhead target
Radials are used when cardinal directions are not appropriate



5.6 Game plan
Following the AO update, JTAC will update Flight on the general game plan. The game plan will inform Flight about the general formula of attack, including:

Type of control
Bomb on coordinate (BOC) or Bomb on target (BOT)
Weapon employment
Deconfliction

5.7 Types of control
JTAC control of CAS employment is divided into 3 types of terminal control. Each follows a set of procedures with associated risk. The 3 types are not ordnance specific.

Type I
Type I is the most restrictive type of control
It is in effect when the risk assessment requires JTAC to visually acquire the attacking aircraft and the target. This allows JTAC to monitor the nose position of the attacking aircraft and verify the correct target is engaged, ensuring first pass success
The attack aircraft validates target location by cross-checking that the position is coincident with the expected target area, using all appropriate means
Aircraft operating under Type I control will transmit an “IP inbound” call, if requested by the JTAC. Prior to weapons release an “IN” call will be provided. The JTAC will give a “cleared hot”, “continue dry” or “abort” call based on his observations

Type II
Type II control will be used when JTAC desires control of individual attacks and/or one or all of the following conditions exist
JTAC is unable to visually acquire the attacking aircraft at weapons release
JTAC is unable to visually acquire the target
The attacking aircraft is unable to acquire the mark or target prior to weapons release
Examples are night, adverse weather, high threat tactics, high altitude or standoff weapons employment
Successful attacks under these conditions depend on accurate targeting data. When delivering GPS/INS or unguided weapons on GPS coordinates, attack aircraft will confirm targeting location with the JTAC
Digital or data link systems capable of displaying aircraft track, sensor point of interest, etc. significantly increase situational awareness that better enable JTAC to authorize weapons release when he’s unable to visually acquire the attacking aircraft
Like in Type I, aircraft operating under Type II will transmit an “IP inbound” call if requested by JTAC. Prior to weapons release an “IN” call will be provided. The JTAC will give a “cleared hot”, “continue dry” or “abort” call based on his observations


Type III
Type III control may be used when attacks impose low risks of fratricide
When Type III control is authorized, JTAC provides clearance for multiple attacks within a single engagement, which meet the restrictions set by the JTAC. Attack aircraft flight leaders may then initiate attacks within the parameters imposed by the JTAC.
The JTAC will monitor radio transmissions and other available digital information to maintain control of the attacks
Aircraft under Type III control will provide an “IP inbound” call, if requested. Prior to the engagement, the attacking aircraft will transmit “commencing engagement” to the JTAC. After the attack(s), “engagement complete” will be provided
JTAC maintains authority throughout the attack(s)


Flexibility

It is not uncommon to have different types of control in effect at one time for different flights. The JTAC maintains the flexibility to change the type of control at any time. This change must be made prior to the “IN” call for Type I and II attacks and the commencing call for Type III.
If a type change is required after these calls, JTAC should abort the attack and brief the aircraft
5.8 Bomb on coordinate (BOC) and bomb on target (BOT)

JTAC will state the method of attack, whether BOC or BOT, as part of the game plan prior to the CAS brief. These methods of attack apply to all types of control and all ordnance employed in the CAS mission


BOC attack: all aircraft delivering ordnance must read back Line 4 and 6 (see next chapter “CAS brief”) from their system or weapon, as appropriate, in conjunction with other required restrictions


BOT attack: only the lead aircraft is required to read back Line 4 and 6, in conjunction with other required restrictions. All aircraft will conduct readbacks if requested by JTAC


BOT attack requires that the JTAC’s intended target or mark is TALLY/CONTACT/CAPTURED (see chapter “Brevity”) by the aircrew. Coordinate accuracy and precision are not as important as the JTAC’s ability to aid CAS aircraft in acquiring the target.
Coordinates provided in the CAS brief must be of sufficient fidelity to provide initial cueing to the attacking aircraft and be used for fires approval.
If at any point during the CAS engagement the attack aircrew is required to gain TALLY/CONTACT/CAPTURE the target, it is a BOT attack


Type I control is always a BOT attack, due to the requirement for the attacking aircraft to be either visual with the target or the mark. Types II and III can be either BOT or BOC for any ordnance


JTAC must be aware when to elect Type I, II or III control


5.9 CAS brief (9-line brief)

Following the game plane, JTACs will use a standardized briefing to pass information rapidly. The CAS brief is also known as the “9-Line Brief,” and is the standard for use with FW and RW aircraft.

The brief consists of:
1 - IP/BP
2 - HEADING
3 - DISTANCE
4 - TARGET ELEVATION
5 - TARGET DESCRIPTION
6 - TARGET LOCATION
7 - TYPE OF MARK
8 - LOCATION OF FRIENDLIES
9 - EGRESS
REMARKS/RESTRICTIONS
JTAC will provide 9-line brief as clear as possible, generally in groups of 3
Line numbers will not be transmitted, however if lines 1-3 were abbreviated, the elevation transmission should begin with “Elevation”
Blank line can be defined as N/A (for line consistency)
Lines 4, 6 and REMARKS are mandatory readback. JTAC can request additional readback
Receiving 9-line brief and correct read back DOES NOT authorize weapon release

With the conclusion of the 9-line brief, JTAC will control the engagement with the attacking aircraft passing IP in order to conduct the CAS as briefed through use of standardized brevity, followed by battle damage assessment (BDA) and re-attack or release from CAS.

x.1 - Ship Layout
x.2 - Long Range Laser Lineup System
The small size of the landing area requires precise lineup control by approaching aircraft. The nature of angled deck carriers presents a unique challenge to arriving aircraft, because the landing area is constantly moving from left to right relative to the nose of the aircraft. To aid aircrew during the approach, carriers are equipped with a Long Range Laser Lineup System. The Long Range Laser Lineup System uses eye-safe, color-coded lasers to provide visual lineup information to approaching aircraft. These low intensity lasers are projected aft of the ship and are visible out to 10 miles at night. Figure below illustrates the visual presentation of the Long Range Laser Lineup System.
