all public information - sources ( P-816.pdf, ATP-3.3.4.2 )  	 	  
## 1.0 Internal Operations
## 2.0 Carrier Departure
### 2.1 CASE I Departure 
This departure may be utilized when it is anticipated that flights will not encounter instrument conditions during
departures and rendezvous with weather conditions no lower than 3,000 feet and 5 nm visibility.

Line up at the Catapult and Launch:
Lead aircraft will line up first, the wingmen will line up on other available Catapults, if none available, line up behind the JBD (Jet Blast Deflector). Preferred catapults if free is in the following order:

After the lead got Take-Off Clearance he will announce “spooling up” and when his wingman on CAT III is also at 80% RPM and both called out “in the green” Lead announces “Full Afterburner”  both engage lights and go full AB, do a quick full deflection of all control surfaces to have deck crew observe correct working controls, center stick and launch will start within a few seconds.

Notes: 
CAT I + CAT III and CAT II + CAT IV can takeoff together 
Between CAT I and CAT II or CAT III and CAT IV launches is a separation of minimum 20(30 IRL) seconds required 

After Launch from the Catapult CASE I:
After a clearing turn, proceed straight ahead paralleling the BRC at 500 feet until 7 DME. Aircraft are then cleared to
climb unrestricted in visual conditions.

Clearing Turn:
A clearing turn is executed to create upwind separation between departing aircraft and aircraft remaining in the landing pattern. It also serves as a visual signal of the aircraft’s intent to depart the carrier. A clearing turn shall be executed during all case I and II launches when the aircraft is departing the carrier. Clearing turns shall be made to the right off the bow catapults  and to the left off the waist catapults for 20 degrees of heading chang followed by a reversal of turn to parallel the BRC. Clearing turns shall not be executed by aircraft during case III launches or when the aircraft intends to remain in the landing pattern.

Launch Frequencies: Aircraft shall normally launch on the departure frequency that shall be monitored by the tower.
