## **2. Target Summary**
The Air Defence Academy is an **active deployment site** coordinating **regional air defense assets**. The facility hosts a **variety of SAM systems, AAA, and artillery**, making it a high-risk, high-value target.

### **Enemy Threats**
- **SA-2 SAM system** (Long-range air defense)  
- **SA-6 SAM system** (Medium-range air defense)  
- **SA-15 SAM system** (Short-range point defense)  
- **AAA emplacements** (Covering approach routes)  
- **Artillery units** (Engaging air and ground targets)  
- **Convoy preparing to move** (Potential reinforcement or supply mission)  

## **3. Rules of Engagement (ROE)**
- **Weapons Free** on all confirmed enemy air defense and military targets.  
- **Avoid collateral damage** to civilian infrastructure.  
- **Minimize exposure** to enemy radar and AAA by maintaining low-level ingress and egress.  

## **4. Mission Phases**
### **Phase 1: Ingress**
- Utilize **low-altitude approach** to avoid early detection.  
- Conduct **preliminary ISR** to confirm target positions and convoy movement.  

### **Phase 2: SEAD Operations**
- Suppress or destroy **SA-2, SA-6, and SA-15 SAM systems**.  
- Neutralize **AAA and artillery positions** to reduce defensive capabilities.  

### **Phase 3: Target Strike**
- If feasible, conduct **precision strikes on logistical nodes** to disrupt enemy supply lines.  
- Monitor convoy movementâ€”if deemed high priority, **engage convoy assets**.  

### **Phase 4: Egress**
- Maintain **high-speed, low-altitude exit** to avoid retaliation.  
- Confirm **enemy response activity** and provide mission debriefing.  

## **5. Support Assets**
- **SEAD Flights:** Dedicated to suppressing SAM threats.  
- **ISR Aircraft/Drones:** Providing real-time reconnaissance and target confirmation.  
- **Strike Aircraft:** Engaging primary and secondary targets.  
- **AWACS:** Coordinating airspace management and enemy tracking.  

## **6. Success Criteria**
- **SA-2, SA-6, and SA-15 SAM systems neutralized.**  
- **AAA and artillery positions suppressed.**  
- **Convoy disruption achieved (if deemed critical).**  
- **Minimal friendly casualties and successful exfiltration.**
