# CAMAPGIN OPERATION BRIEFING: OP BEOWULF

## **Mission Overview**

### **Situation**
Syria has initiated aggressive military preparations with the intent to annex Lebanon, claiming historical territorial rights. NATO forces have been deployed to support Lebanon in repelling this invasion and maintaining regional stability. The region is experiencing heightened tensions, with Syrian leadership making public statements justifying their expansionist goals, citing historical claims and perceived regional security threats. Diplomatic efforts have failed, and intelligence suggests that Syrian forces are mobilizing for a large-scale cross-border invasion.

The Syrian military has amassed a significant force near the Lebanese border, positioning both armored and mechanized divisions alongside a network of entrenched artillery positions. Reports indicate that Syrian forces are also mobilizing special forces units for potential asymmetric warfare and sabotage operations inside Lebanese territory.

Lebanese defenses are stretched thin, with their military relying on a combination of entrenched defensive positions and mobile response units to delay the Syrian advance until NATO reinforcements can be fully operational. Lebanese government officials have issued emergency declarations and are coordinating closely with NATO for strategic planning and logistical support.

Regional allies and neutral parties are closely monitoring the situation. There is concern that Hezbollah or other non-state actors may exploit the chaos to advance their own agendas, further complicating the operational environment.

## **Enemy Forces (Syria)**

### **Command and Control**
- **Palmyra and Durayhim Military Base:** Primary Syrian command and control centers overseeing air and ground operations.
- **Early Warning Radar Installations:** Located at **Durayhim, Palmyra, and Sayqal** to provide air defense tracking and target acquisition.

### **Air Defense Assets**
Syria has deployed a formidable array of surface-to-air missile systems, including:
- **SA-2** (Sayqal, Air Defense Academy)
- **SA-6** (Army Vehicle Training Grounds, Grid 36 S YD 73297 68825, Minakh)
- **SA-8, SA-9, SA-13, SA-15, SA-19** (Mobile, constantly repositioned)
- **SA-10** (Chemical Weapons Storage Area near Palmyra, Durayhim Military Base)
- **SA-11** (Khalkhalah, Grid 37 S BV 33996 14348)

NATO reconnaissance has observed that **some SA-15 systems provide point defense for key installations but are highly mobile.** Additionally, mobile **SA-8, SA-9, SA-13, and SA-19 systems are frequently moved to avoid detection.** MANPADS (Man-Portable Air Defense Systems) are expected to be deployed throughout the operational area.

### **Ground Forces**
Syria has mobilized hundreds of ground units, including:
- **Main Battle Tanks:** T-72
- **Infantry Fighting Vehicles:** BTR series
- **Support Vehicles:** Trucks, Cars
- **Artillery:** Multiple artillery batteries positioned for cross-border bombardment
- **Special Forces:** Units trained for sabotage, infiltration, and asymmetric operations

### **Air Assets**
Syria is operating a mix of Soviet-era and modern aircraft from multiple airbases:
- **Palmyra Airbase:** MiG-29, MiG-25, MiG-23, MiG-21, Su-24
- **Jirah Airbase:** MiG-29, MiG-25, MiG-23, MiG-21, Su-24
- **Tabqa Airbase:** Additional Su-24 strike aircraft

Syrian pilots have been observed conducting aggressive flight maneuvers and intercepts along the border region, increasing the likelihood of direct engagements with NATO air forces. At present, the Syrian Air Force maintains control over its airspace, posing a significant threat to NATO operations.

## **Friendly Forces (NATO & Allies)**

### **Naval Operations**
Two **NATO Carrier Battle Groups** (**CBG-5 & CBG-8**) are deployed **north of Cyprus**, providing air and missile support.  

#### **Carrier Air Wing Assets**

- **E-2A Hawkeyes** – **Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C)**.  
- **S-3B Vikings** – Providing **aerial refueling and anti-submarine warfare**.  

#### **Surface Combatants**
- **Arleigh Burke-class destroyers** (part of CBG escort fleet):  
  - Capable of launching **Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs)** for **long-range precision strikes**.  
  - Equipped with **Aegis combat system** for integrated air and missile defense.  

### **Air Operations**

  - **KC-130 Tanker** (Basket)
  - **KC-135 Tanker** (Basket/Boom)

### **Strategic Bomber Support**
- **B-1B Lancer** and **B-52 Stratofortress** bombers are available for strategic airstrikes.
- **Long-range precision strikes** include:
  - **AGM-86 ALCM (Air-Launched Cruise Missile)**
  - **AGM-84 Harpoon**
  - **AGM-154 JSOW (Joint Standoff Weapon)**
  - **JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition) precision bombing**
  - **Cluster bombing and carpet bombing operations**

### **Ground Forces**
NATO has landed reinforcements at the Port of Kiryat Motzkin, including:
- **M1 Abrams Tanks**
- **M2 Bradley IFVs**
- **MaxxPro MRAPs**
- **Humvees**
These forces are moving towards forward operating bases (FOBs) to establish defensive and offensive staging points.

### **Forward Operating Bases (FOBs)**
- **FOB Alpha** *(Grid: 36 S YC 55418 24537)*
  - Staging base for air and ground assault operations
  - Equipped with:
    - **AH-64 Apache Attack Helicopters**
    - **OH-58 Kiowa Scouts**
    - **CH-47 Chinook Transports**

- **FOB Bravo** *(Grid: 37 S BT 32677 74560)*
  - Staging base for ground assault operations
  - Supply and logistics hub
  - Primary resupply point for rotary-wing aircraft and ground forces

## **Mission Objectives**
1. **Air Superiority:** Conduct SEAD operations to neutralize Syrian SAM threats and enforce NATO's no-fly zone over Syria.
2. **Naval Dominance:** Secure the eastern Mediterranean to protect supply routes and provide air cover.
3. **FOB Security & Reinforcement:** Ensure FOB Alpha and Bravo remain operational and fully supplied.
4. **Counter-Offensive Preparation:** Establish a defensive line and prepare for counterattacks against Syrian forces.
5. **Protect Lebanese Sovereignty:** Prevent Syrian forces from breaching Lebanese territory.
6. **Monitor and Counter Insurgent Threats:** Be prepared for non-state actors attempting to exploit the conflict.

### **No-Fly Zone Enforcement**
NATO has formally established a **No-Fly Zone (NFZ) over Syria** to prevent Syrian Air Force operations. However, Syrian forces continue to challenge this restriction, conducting flights from their airbases and maintaining aerial control over their own territory. **Mission-critical objectives include enforcing the NFZ, neutralizing Syrian air threats, and establishing NATO air superiority.** Carrier-based and land-based CAP (Combat Air Patrol) missions are being conducted to intercept and engage non-compliant Syrian aircraft when necessary.

## **Intel Summary**
- Syrian forces are actively preparing for an invasion.
- Air defenses are strong but outdated; NATO electronic warfare and SEAD assets will be critical.
- Syrian airpower is a mix of older Soviet-era jets with limited effectiveness against modern NATO aircraft.
- A rapid response is required to prevent Syrian forces from gaining a foothold in Lebanon.
- **Potential threats from non-state actors and insurgent groups require constant monitoring.**
- **Enforcing the no-fly zone is essential to achieving NATO air superiority.**
- **Syria's mobile SAM systems pose a dynamic threat; intelligence gathering and real-time target updates are critical.**
